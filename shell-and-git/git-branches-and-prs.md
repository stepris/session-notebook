Continue to work on your session notebook.

First create a new branch called "notes/github-and-markdown".
Switch on that branch and start working on the respective session note. Fill the session note with short hints and command collections you find helpful.
Commit regularly after each step and use good commit messages.
When you are satisfied with the session note, push the content of the branch to the remote repository (git push -u origin notes/github-and-markdown).
On GitHub, go to the remote repository. A yellow action box should have appeared suggesting to create a pull request for the named branch. Create the pull request.
Share the link to the pull request with your group so they can review your notes.
Merge the pull request or add some suggestions of your group mates.
Repeat this workflow with the other session notes you created the last days.
ðŸ’¡ This workflow is very fundamental to web developers in all of the industry. We will continue to work in this way, especially in the capstone project. So try to get comfortable with each step, it will become second nature very quickly.
